2. By another interpretation, muenia isexpisined as :nondum
oeoupata, a nemine adhue 11101010, i e. things never before handled, in
short, new san'eeis3 andpropn'emeans ιὀαροωὶὶωοτ original naam.
'lhe sense 01 the whole passage, which ir given 1] this interpretation,
is kindred to that ehieh isststed abore. But the method seems obiee-
tioneble, 1001οω ommia osu mean nntried or new subjecte, only 1]

8. Τ10 third interpretation, while it takes the same view 01 propria
as No. 2, takes an exaotly opposite one 01 munem, and makes
that = iam ooenpata et nota, i. e. thIngs oiten handled and well known,
in short, old subjecte. The sense oi the whole passage, giren by this
interpretationis this: itis diffloult to handle common subjeets in an
original manner, and yet you had better do this, 1] dnmatistng the
lllsd, than be the iirst to handle new eubJ‘eeis. The obvious objeetlon
here is, that there is no sneh linlr ln the original between the tero parts
01 the passage us is expressed 1] ascl yet. The Editors, who interpret ,
thus, tramitte taque by ond 'yet yos,- just as ii Heraea had written
“ tn tamen,” “nihiloniinus tn '’ (Orelli). indeed a Latin paraphrase 01
Vineentlus Gandius (quoted 1] a eelebrated Editor trem the Brttish
crltlo, Vol 1, p. stt, and adopted by him) has these words: “hune
1οΜ ego nonatum tibi suadeo.” 01 this whole interpretation, it seems
