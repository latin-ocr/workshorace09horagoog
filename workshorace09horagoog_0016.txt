oen work reeently published‚ Andrews’s hetin hexioou3 the
other referenoes need no pnrtieulsr explanation

The Life oi Hortos, whieh hes been written for the work,
together with the briei estimste eonneoted with it oi the ohsr
soter end writings of the poet, will perhaps bs s sonroe of
some interest end velue to the student

The illustratione, whieh hese been introduced with s view
ut ones to the embellishment end the usefulness oi the book,
hese been, with three exceptione, tuken from Rieh’s Ilius·
truted Oompsnion3 those on peges 204 and 241 hove been
tehen from Beoker’s Gallus, und the one on pege 309 from
Milmnn’s elegunt edition of Herses.

Itis hoped thet the superior meohsnieel exeuntion ol ths
volume will gain the attention and prsise ehieh it merits3 und
I esnnot but soknowledge the very liberal manner in ehieh
the Publiehers hsve superintended it, speriug no peine or ex·
pense to melre it ss perfeet ue possible.

I susil myself of this opportunity to make my grateful
uehnowledgments to Professors end Olassiesl Teuchers for the
very fuvorthle reeeption whieh they hsve given to my edition
of Livy; und to express the hope thst the present work, the
result oie lsrger experienee snd of inore extended labore,
moy be'found not unworthy oi their approbetion
